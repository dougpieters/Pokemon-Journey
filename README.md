# Pokemon-Journey
This project is just for fun, and a way for me to test and utilize the skills I develop as I learn and understand Python more.

As of our first commit, the program runs up to the first rival fight after receiving your Pokemon from Professor Oak.
Some dialogue pacing still needs to be adjusted in the last half. Otherwise, functional up to that fight.

Before I continue with story elements, my next goals are to get all of the basic functionalities completed:
  - Buff/Debuff system working for status changing moves like Growl & Tail Whip
  - Experience system with proper exp rewards and requirements
  - Level up system that provides stat changes
  - A Party/PC Box system, limiting Party to 6 Pokemon.
  - Deeper move system that includes;
    a. A restricted list to contain no more than 4 moves at a time
    b. Check system that identifies when 4 moves are in the list, and prompt options to select a move to replace with new move
    c. Integrated with the leveling system to prompt this system to activate and apphend/replace to this list
  - An evolution system that includes;
    a. Properly replacing Pokemon species
    b. Increasing/updating stats to reflect new Pokemon
    c. Keep given Nickname
    d. Prompt learning any moves on evolution
    
    
As of 12.15.22 Update:
  Buff/Debuff system has been implemented and working
